# Media generation

User can review his knowledge in data table that can be sorted (for example by stability of memorization). Then he can select words and use them to generate media file:
- audio
- video

Both forms contain chunks with:
- word
- word translation
- sentence
- sentence translation

## Audio

Audio files are generated in seconds directly in browser.

## Video

Video generation takes minutes and is done on server side. 

For video as visual layer we are using images from word cards 
and text of sentences displayed on top of them.
